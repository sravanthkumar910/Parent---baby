11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,hard,analytical,Why do hurricanes lose strength after reaching land?,Because they no longer get energy from warm ocean water.,"['Hurricanes need warm, moist air for energy.', 'Land is cooler and has more friction.', 'Without heat and moisture, the storm weakens quickly.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,easy,conceptual,What do meteorologists do?,They study the weather and predict future conditions.,"['Meteorologists collect data using satellites and sensors.', 'They analyze air pressure, wind, and temperature.', 'Their forecasts help people prepare for weather changes.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,medium,reasoning,Why are deserts often found near 30° latitude?,"Because dry air from high-altitude winds sinks there, creating arid zones.","['Warm air rises near the equator and moves poleward.', 'It cools, sinks, and warms again near 30° latitude.', 'Sinking air blocks clouds, keeping the region dry.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,hard,analytical,How does urbanization influence local climate?,It creates heat islands with higher temperatures than rural areas.,"['Buildings and roads absorb and trap heat.', 'Less vegetation reduces cooling by evaporation.', 'Cities become warmer, changing local weather slightly.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,medium,experimental,How can you model a rain shadow effect?,Use a spray bottle and box mountain to show one side dry and the other wet.,"[""Spray water vapor on one side of the 'mountain'."", ""It condenses and 'rains' on that side."", 'The other side stays dry, like in real mountains.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,hard,analytical,How does Earth's rotation affect global wind patterns?,It causes winds to curve due to the Coriolis effect.,"['Earth spins from west to east.', 'Moving air appears to curve right in the Northern Hemisphere.', 'This bending shapes trade winds and jet streams.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,easy,conceptual,What do we call the study of weather?,Meteorology is the study of weather and atmosphere.,"['Meteorology involves observing and measuring air conditions.', 'It studies how air pressure, temperature, and humidity interact.', 'The goal is to understand and predict weather patterns.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,medium,reasoning,Why do equatorial regions have frequent thunderstorms?,"Because warm, moist air rises quickly and forms large clouds.","['The equator receives intense sunlight all year.', 'Warm air rises, cools, and condenses.', 'This forms tall clouds that produce heavy rain and lightning.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,hard,analytical,How might volcanic eruptions affect climate temporarily?,"They release ash and gases that block sunlight, cooling the Earth.","['Volcanoes eject sulfur dioxide and dust into the air.', 'These particles reflect sunlight back to space.', 'This lowers global temperatures for months or years.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,medium,reasoning,Why do areas near the equator have higher biodiversity?,"Because warm, stable climates support more plant and animal life.","['The equator gets steady sunlight and rain.', 'Conditions support year-round plant growth.', 'This creates habitats for many species to thrive.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,hard,analytical,How can air pollution influence local weather?,It can trap heat and cause more smog or acid rain.,"['Pollutants absorb heat, warming the air near cities.', 'Particles also form clouds that block sunlight.', 'Some chemicals mix with rain to make it acidic.']"
11-12,Science,Weather patterns and climate zones,easy,conceptual,What is a rainbow?,A colorful arc formed when sunlight passes through raindrops.,"['Sunlight bends and splits into colors in raindrops.', 'Light reflects inside and exits at different angles.', 'We see a spectrum of colors forming a rainbow.']"
